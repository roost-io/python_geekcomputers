================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
Issue: The code uses the 'random' module for generating random numbers, which is not cryptographically secure and may lead to predictable values.
Solution: Replace 'import random' with 'import secrets' for cryptographically strong pseudo-random number generation suitable for security-sensitive applications.

Vulnerability: CWE-916: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
Issue: The code does not apply any password hashing technique to the generated sequence, storing it in plain text. This can result in rapid cracking if the sequence is compromised.
Solution: Implement a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt, scrypt, or PBKDF2 with sufficient iterations to protect the generated sequence against cracking attempts.

Vulnerability: CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements
Issue: The 'gen_sequence' function relies on the provided 'conditions' to determine the character sets used, but does not enforce any minimum length or complexity requirements, potentially allowing weak sequences.
Solution: Enforce minimum length and complexity requirements for the generated sequence, such as a minimum of 12 characters and mandating the inclusion of characters from at least 3 out of the 4 character sets.

Vulnerability: CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
Issue: The 'possible_characters' list is hard-coded within the function, making it easily discoverable by an attacker who gains access to the source code.
Solution: Move the 'possible_characters' list outside of the function and consider loading it from a secure configuration file or environment variable to reduce exposure.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test generation of a sequence with all character types included
Details:
  TestName: test_gen_sequence_all_character_types
  Description: This test verifies that the gen_sequence function correctly generates a sequence containing all character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits, and punctuation) when all conditions are set to True.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of conditions with all elements set to True.
  Act: Call the gen_sequence function with the prepared conditions list.
  Assert: Check that the returned sequence contains at least one character from each character type (lowercase, uppercase, digits, and punctuation).
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the gen_sequence function includes all desired character types in the generated sequence when all conditions are met, aligning with the business requirement of generating a diverse password.

Scenario 2: Test generation of a sequence with no character types included
Details:
  TestName: test_gen_sequence_no_character_types
  Description: This test verifies that the gen_sequence function returns an empty sequence when all conditions are set to False.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of conditions with all elements set to False.
  Act: Call the gen_sequence function with the prepared conditions list.
  Assert: Check that the returned sequence is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the gen_sequence function does not include any characters in the generated sequence when no conditions are met, preventing the generation of invalid passwords.

Scenario 3: Test generation of a sequence with a single character type included
Details:
  TestName: test_gen_sequence_single_character_type
  Description: This test verifies that the gen_sequence function correctly generates a sequence containing only the specified character type when a single condition is set to True.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of conditions with only one element set to True (e.g., lowercase characters).
  Act: Call the gen_sequence function with the prepared conditions list.
  Assert: Check that the returned sequence contains only characters from the specified character type (e.g., lowercase characters) and no other character types.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the gen_sequence function includes only the desired character type in the generated sequence when a single condition is met, aligning with the business requirement of generating a password with specific character types.

Scenario 4: Test generation of a sequence with multiple character types included
Details:
  TestName: test_gen_sequence_multiple_character_types
  Description: This test verifies that the gen_sequence function correctly generates a sequence containing multiple specified character types when multiple conditions are set to True.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of conditions with multiple elements set to True (e.g., lowercase and uppercase characters).
  Act: Call the gen_sequence function with the prepared conditions list.
  Assert: Check that the returned sequence contains characters from all the specified character types (e.g., lowercase and uppercase characters) and no other character types.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the gen_sequence function includes all the desired character types in the generated sequence when multiple conditions are met, aligning with the business requirement of generating a password with a combination of specific character types.

Scenario 5: Test generation of a sequence with an empty conditions list
Details:
  TestName: test_gen_sequence_empty_conditions
  Description: This test verifies that the gen_sequence function handles an empty conditions list correctly and returns an empty sequence.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list of conditions.
  Act: Call the gen_sequence function with the empty conditions list.
  Assert: Check that the returned sequence is an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the gen_sequence function gracefully handles the case when no conditions are provided, returning an empty sequence instead of raising an error or generating an invalid password.
